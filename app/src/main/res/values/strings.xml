\n\nFuelled by high doses of CREAPURE CREATINE, the carb complex quickly shuttles creatine into the muscle, promoting anabolism, muscle glycogen replenishment and hence enables you to get bigger, lift heavier and blast through your workouts.

\n\nThe scientific blend of glutamine (3gm/serving) BCAA’s (3gm/serving) and multivitamins ensure optimum protein absorption by your muscles and speed up your post workout recovery and fatigue and prevent muscle breakdown and catabolism.

\n\n<b>FOR BEST RESULT-</b> use Rapid lean with safe and sensible but heavy lifting, done 3-4 times per week along with a generous intake of 4-5 solid protein rich meals spaced evenly throughout the day. Eat animal proteins like chicken, fish, eggs etc or skimmed dairy products at least three times a day.
